# TOMCAT description

This repository aims to be a public, updatable, version controlled document describing the [TOMCAT beamline](http://psi.ch/sls/tomcat) at the [Swiss Light Source](http://psi.ch/sls).

The actual website (currently http://habi.github.io/TOMCAT-Description/, for demonstration purposes) is automatically generated from the [Markdown-formatted](index.md) index-file.
This file can be [edited online](https://github.com/habi/TOMCAT-Description/edit/gh-pages/index.md) by all collaborators on the project, or by a `git pull`, edit and `git push` from your local machine.
