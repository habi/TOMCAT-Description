# TOMCAT description

This repository aims to be a public, updatable, version controlled document describing the [TOMCAT beamline](http://psi.ch/sls/tomcat) at the [Swiss Light Source](http://psi.ch/sls).

The actual website (currently available [here](http://habi.github.io/TOMCAT-Description/), for demonstration purposes), lives in the [`gh-pages`](https://github.com/habi/TOMCAT-Description/tree/gh-pages) branch of this repository.

This is *obviously* a **test-repository** to show some possibilities for the [TCOPS-72](https://tracker.psi.ch/jira/browse/TCOPS-72) issue.
