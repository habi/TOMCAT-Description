# TOMCAT description

This repository aims to be a public, updatable, version controlled document describing the [TOMCAT beamline](http://psi.ch/sls/tomcat) at the [Swiss Light Source](http://psi.ch/sls).

The [actual website](http://habi.github.io/TOMCAT-Description/) (only ford mardemonstration purposes) is automatically generated from the [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) formatted [index.md file](index.md).
This file can be [edited online](https://github.com/habi/TOMCAT-Description/edit/gh-pages/index.md) by all collaborators on the project, or by a `git pull`, edit and `git push` from your local machine.

This is *obviously* a **test-repository** to show some possibilities for the [TCOPS-72](https://tracker.psi.ch/jira/browse/TCOPS-72) issue.
